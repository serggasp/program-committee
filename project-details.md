# Call for Capstone Projects (COMP9900/COMP3900) T1, 2025 

Please complete this form if you would like to offer a project to Computer Science and IT cohorts at CSE. Please complete one form per project.
Students will work collaborativelly to design and develop innovative software/system applications for your project requirements and problems. All projects must include software/system desing and development (e.g., web/mobile application, software system, software tools). No low code or zero-code or pure research projects.  
The project will run for 1 term (17 Feb. - 27 Apr.) which will involve planning, designing, development, testing, and demonstrations of work.  
Project details should be provided by clients (project owners) and should have clear requirements and scope, outcomes, and reasonable size (for group of 5-6 students working over 8 weeks)  
For any inquiries contact Industry Capstone Liaison Officer Dr. Basem Suleiman (b.suleiman@unsw.edu.au) and Dr. Yuchao Jiang ( Yuchao.jiang@unsw.edu.au)  

## 1. Client/supervisor (and co-supervisor/co-client) names  
Serge Gaspers

## 2. Client/supervisor (and co-supervisor/co-client) emails  
serge.gaspers@unsw.edu.au

## 3. Project title  
Conference program committee recommender system

## 4. Project background & goals  
The client is a program committee chair and needs to create a program committee for a computer science conference.
A program committee (PC) consists of members of the academic community and is in charge of deciding which submitted papers get accepted into the program of the conference.
This project develops a recommender system in a real-world scenario and will consist of a software system to help create such a PC.

## 5. Project scope  
This includes
- identifying topics of expertise that the PC needs to cover, based on textual data from webpages or calls for papers from previous editions of the conference
- predicting how many papers will be submitted in each topic based on the publication data of previous years (match papers to topics based on title, abstract, keywords)
- recommending academics to the PC
- recommending additions to a partially formed PC
- facilitating invitation via email to an up-to-date email address
Data will be obtained from DBLP, Google Scholar, ORCID, academic web pages, conference web pages, conference calls for papers.

## 6. Project requirements (detailed description of the features/specification of the software/system to be designed & implemented)  
It is expected that this system will be used in multiple rounds to process the information of who accepst/declines the invitation to be on the PC.
The system should allow to recommend academics to the PC
- covering the needed expertise, by taking into account that each submitted paper will be assigned to multiple (typically 3) PC members
- prioritise academics who have published often at the conference (especially recently); this data should be obtained from [DBLP](https://dblp.org/)
- prioritise diversity in terms of seniority, location, gender (this data needs to be scraped/learned/estimated)
- handle manual inclusion/exclusion from the PC (invited speakers are typically excluded, academics who have already declined/accepted the invitation to the PC)
- handle manually entered estimates of reliability of academics
It should visualize these recommendations in a succinct way and facilitate the selection of the next group of academics to be invited to the PC.

## 7. Required knowledge and skills (that students should posses to work on the project)  
Everyone on the team should be familiar with Git and Python.  
The team should have expertise in web scraping, machine learning classification, and web development

## 8. Expected outcomes and deliverables (e.g., source code, documentation, user guide)  
Functioning system, open source code, documentation, user guide

## 9. Disciplines related to the project (choose all that apply)  

Software Development

Web Application Development

Artificial Intelligence (Machine/Deep Learning, NLP)

Big data Analytics and Visualization

## 10. Any other information or resources (to be shared with the students or the capston project coordinators)  

## 11. How many (max no.) groups would you accept to work on this project? (from experience, it's strongly recommended to consider working with 2-3 groups for each project so that you get different solutions to choose from or integrate together)  

3 groups
